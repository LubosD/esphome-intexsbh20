# How to contribute to the Intex PureSpa WiFi remote control project

To get an overview of the project, start by reading the [README](README.md).

## Issues

If you spot a problem, have a question or want to suggest an improvement,
please search if a similar or identical issue already exists. If you cannot find
something, you can open a new issue.

Respect the [GitHub Cummunity Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct).

Do not promote external projects where you or persons affiliated with you
are invested commercially. If you think such a promotion might support
this project, open an issue to request permission.

## Merge Requests (Bugs, Features)

- Merge requests containing cosmetical changes in lines without functional
  changes will not be accepted. Do not use auto-formatters to "beautify"
  existing code. Stay with the existing coding and formatting style.

- Keep the changes for one pull request limited to one feature only.

- Base your merge request on the latests commit from develop branch and
  create a merge request to the *develop* branch (and not to the master
  branch). When a merge request cannot be handled by the maintainers
  immediately it might become necessary to repeat this process if other
  updates have been added to the project in the meantime.

- In case of a feature request consider adding to the documentation in
  the [README](README.md).
